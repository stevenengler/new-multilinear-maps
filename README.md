# Python Wrapper for a Proof-of-Concept Implementation of the "New" Multilinear Maps over the Integers

This is a Python wrapper for an implementation of the "new" variant of the cryptographic multilinear maps over the Integers.

This is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/tlepoint/new-multilinear-maps), but includes some changes as well as the Python wrapper.

This variant is described in the following article:

[1] J.-S. Coron, T. Lepoint, M. Tibouchi, "New Multilinear Maps over the Integers". Available on http://eprint.iacr.org

and builds upon the following article:

[2] J.-S. Coron, T. Lepoint, M. Tibouchi, "Practical Multilinear Maps over the Integers". Available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/183

This C++ proof-of-concept and Python wrapper requires:
- *GMP* http://gmplib.org/
- *fplll* (to generate parameters) https://github.com/dstehle/fplll
- *SWIG* http://www.swig.org/

HOW TO RUN?
-----------

First, modify the Makefile accordingly.

To generate the public parameters (requires fplll)
--------------------------------------------------

```
$ make generate_pp
$ ./generate_pp -l 52 -k 6 -n 540 -r 52 -e 420
``` 

Explaination of the parameters: *-l* is the expected security level (lambda), *-k* is the multilinearity level (kappa), *-n* is the number of primes used, *-r* is the noise size (rho), *-e* is the size of the factors in the primes (etap). By default, running without argument yields the values of above.

This creates a directory *lambda52-kappa6* with all the public parameters of the multilinear map.

Note that all the arguments must be chosen to ensure sufficient security according to [1] and [2]. This is not performed by our implementation.

To run a kappa+1 Diffie-Hellman key exchange
--------------------------------------------

```
$ make key_generation
$ ./key_generation -l 52 -k 6
``` 

This requires the multilinear maps public parameters (created by __generate_pp__) to be stored in a *lambda52-kappa6/* directory. By default, running without argument yields the values of above.

Explaination of the parameters: *-l* is the expected security level (lambda), *-k* is the multilinearity level (kappa).

Note that there is a branch *with-small-parameters* containing small parameters to allow testing without running __generate_pp__.
